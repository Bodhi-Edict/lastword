1. How long has your team known each other? How did you meet?

	We met in college and were roommates. We've known each other for eight years.

2. How long has your team been actively exploring starting a company? Why did you decide to work together? (Under 200 words)

	 We've wanted to build something together since college but our paths diverged and we ended up in different parts of the world for a few years. We have always had an excellent rapport with each other and though we were working on different things we would often brainstorm with each other and seek advice from one another. 

	We've been actively exploring to start a company for the last three months. Our experiences and skillsets complement each other and align well for the domain we want to work in. So we decided to build an MVP and do some preliminary user testing. The conviction in our idea has deepened and so far we've thoroughly enjoyed working together. 

3. For each team member, share a product, project, or accomplishment you are most proud of and why. (Keep each example under 200 words)

	 Vignesh Prasad - For the past few years, I co-founded a few startups but the project I'm most proud of is the non-profit I started about six years ago. We started as an experiment to create a learner-centric learning space where decisions are made by the children. Today we have grown to six spaces across Bangalore and we work alongside three hundred children. What has been particularly pleasing is that we've managed to stay true to the original vision and keep the spaces learner centric even at scale and in low resource settings. Some of the children in the space have gone on to do very well in high school and are the first in their families to go to college. 

	Likhit Nayak - My PhD research involves working with doctors and nurses in low-resource settings to build tools that would improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. We are currently working in Ethiopia to develop a tool that would use 3D scans of pregnant women to assess the risk of cephalopelvic disproportion. We needed to develop an iOS app that would help the nurses to collect and process these scans. I built an iOS app that interfaced with the Structure 3D Sensor to acquire and process 3D data on an iPad and trained the nurses on using this tool. I also helped set up data collection sites for obtaining these scans at four different public health centres in Ethiopia. So far, this app has been used to collect more than 2500 3D scans thus building the biggest such dataset for gestation.

5. What ideas are you exploring? (Under 200 words)

	 We are working on the Ira Project. Our product redefines assessments with the goal of helping STEM teachers identify gaps in their student's conceptual understanding. Rather than solving questions directly, students explain concepts to Ira (our AI) and teach it how to derive the answers. 

	Using the student's explanations we are able to generate a knowledge graph for every student that teachers can view in a dashboard. 
	

6. What expertise do you have that is related to the ideas you are exploring?

	 We have great founder-market fit due to our experience in education. For the past 7 years, Vignesh has been running a non profit which creates after-school learning spaces for marginalised children. He co-founded the non-profit and is actively engaged in teaching. As a PhD student at Georgia Tech, Likhit has taught multiple courses at different universities and is also involved in the administration of a private school in Bhubaneswar, India. 

	Vignesh has also been a co-founder thrice before and has successfully scaled products to 100k+ users. Likhit has used neural networks extensively in his research and can build and deploy AI models. His expertise in machine learning and teaching experience make him the ideal CTO for developing Ira. 

7. What progress have you made?

	 We've built out a classroom ready version of the product. This is our second iteration after one round of user testing. When we tested our product with students we found that all of them truly enjoyed working with Ira and found themselves challenged. Across a diverse group from different backgrounds, we saw high levels of persistence and noticed that children were thinking critically about the concepts.

	 From a sales and marketing standpoint we have a few pilots set up and ready to kick start once schools reopen. We are in initial talks with a few prospective customers as well. 

8. How does the world look different if you succeed? How big is the market, or how does your idea unlock one?

	Our vision is to completely change the way assessments are done in education. If we succeed all testing in school districts, all competitive exams and all college applications will have a component of students teaching concepts to Ira. The global education market is 2.5 trillion USD and assessment is a huge part of it.
