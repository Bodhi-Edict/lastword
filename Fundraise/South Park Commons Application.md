1. How long has your team known each other? How did you meet?

	We met in college and were roommates. We've known each other for eight years.

2. How long has your team been actively exploring starting a company? Why did you decide to work together? (Under 200 words)

	 We've wanted to build something together since college but our paths diverged and we ended up in different parts of the world for a few years. We have always had an excellent rapport with each other and though we were working on different things we would often brainstorm with each other and seek advice from one another. 

	We've been actively exploring starting a company for the last three months. Our experiences and skillsets complement each other and align well for the domain we want to work in. So we decided to build an MVP and do some preliminary user testing. The conviction in our idea has deepened and so far we've thoroughly enjoyed working together. 

3. For each team member, share a product, project, or accomplishment you are most proud of and why. (Keep each example under 200 words)

	 Vignesh Prasad - For the past few years, I co-founded a few startups but the project I'm most proud of is the non-profit I started about six years ago. We started as an experiment to create a learner-centric learning space where decisions are made by the children. Today we have grown to six spaces across Bangalore and we work alongside three hundred children. What has been particularly pleasing is that we've managed to stay true to the original vision and keep the spaces learner centric even at scale and in low resource settings. Some of the children in the space have gone on to do very well in high school and are the first in their families to go to college. 

	Likhit Nayak - My PhD research involves working with doctors and nurses in low-resource settings to build tools that would improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. We are currently working in Ethiopia to develop a tool that would use 3D scans of pregnant women to assess the risk of cephalopelvic disproportion. We needed to develop a mobile app that would help the nurses to collect and process these scans. I built an iOS app that interfaced with the Structure 3D Sensor to acquire and process 3D data on an iPad and trained the nurses on using this tool. I also helped set up data collection sites for obtaining these scans at four different public health centres in Ethiopia. So far, this app has been used to collect more than 2500 3D scans thus building the biggest such dataset for gestation.

5. What ideas are you exploring? (Under 200 words)

	 We are currently exploring solving a problem that we have both faced while teaching. We are trying to build something that can exactly assess the gaps in the conceptual understanding of students - especially in STEM subjects. Current assignments test for procedural knowledge and teacher's have no standardized method to test for conceptual understanding. 

	 One of our key learnings while teaching was that asking the students to explain concepts revealed gaps in their understanding. However, this is not possible at scale due to a lack of time and resources. We felt that LLMs are best positioned to solve this problem. We have built out the Ira Project to leverage LLMs and redefine assessments. 
	 
	 Rather than solving questions directly, students explain concepts to our AI and teach it how to derive the answers. Using the student's explanations, our AI attempts a set of questions. Students can iterate on their explanations till the AI is able to answer all the questions correctly. Students learn while teaching and we are able to generate a knowledge graph for every student that the teachers can view in their dashboard.

7. What expertise do you have that is related to the ideas you are exploring?

	 We have great founder-market fit due to our experience in education. For the past 7 years, Vignesh has been running a non profit which creates after-school learning spaces for marginalised children. He co-founded the non-profit and is actively engaged in teaching. As a PhD student at Georgia Tech, Likhit has taught multiple courses at different universities and is also involved in the administration of a private school in Bhubaneswar, India. 

	Vignesh has also been a co-founder thrice before and has successfully scaled products to 100k+ users. Likhit has used neural networks extensively in his research and can build and deploy AI models. Our expertise in technology and our teaching experience make us the ideal team to build a company in this space. 

8. What progress have you made?

	 We've built out a classroom ready version of the product. This is our second iteration after one round of user testing. When we tested our product with students we found that all of them truly enjoyed working with our product and found themselves challenged. Across a diverse group from different backgrounds, we saw high levels of persistence and noticed that children were thinking critically about the concepts.

	 From a sales and marketing standpoint we have a few pilots set up and ready to kick start once schools reopen. We are in initial talks with a few prospective customers as well. 

9. How does the world look different if you succeed? How big is the market, or how does your idea unlock one?

	Our vision is to completely change the way assessments are done in education. If we succeed, all testing in school districts, competitive exams and college applications will have a component that evaluates how well students are able to teach/explain concepts to an AI. As of 2023, the global education market is 2.5 trillion USD and assessments are a huge part of it.
