- Studies place the current teacher shortage at 55,000 vacant positions and an additional 270,000 teaching posts currently filled by under qualified teachers.


- Average teacher to student ratio in the US is 15.3 : 1
- The lower the ratio the better the academic achievements of the students.


- One of the main reasons for this is that smaller classes allow teachers to understand each student better
- Smaller classrooms allow for more classroom discussions which gives the teacher information on the student's current knowledge


- We're building a suite of tools that allow teachers to cater to a larger number of students without compromising on the quality of education provided
- Rather than simply trying to save teacher's time we want to build tools that make them more effective


- The most important task to build a platform to support teachers it to gather data about the students and model their understanding
- The first tool that we've built is a formative assessment tool that allows us to graph the knowledge that each student has
- By modeling the students understanding the possibilities are endless


- Personalised study plans depending on the student knowledge state
- Examples, assignments and projects for the student to help them overcome areas of weakness
- Peer matching and group creation among students so they can learn from one another 
- Feedback for teachers on which lessons are most effective and creating better understanding


- Current players focus - making teachers more efficient
