Subject - Ed Tech for an AI Driven Future - Pre-Seed

Hi ___

Fund specific opening paragraph

Artificial Intelligence has completely changed the way the world works. Our current education system does not provide students with the skills necessary to thrive in the future. 

At Ira Project we're building a suite of tools that helps prepare students for an AI driven future. 

Here's a link to our [deck](https://docsend.com/view/8gfsu4angat4zrdr)

We're currently raising a $500k pre seed. Would you be open to getting on a call? 

Best, 
Vignesh Prasad
CEO, Ira Project
