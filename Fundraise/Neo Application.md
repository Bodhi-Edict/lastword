1. Short Description

Our product redifines formative assesments with the goal of helping STEM teachers identify gaps in their student's conceptual understanding. Rather than solving questions directly, students explain concepts to Ira (our AI) and teach it how to derive the answers.

2. What is your market and how big is it? What is your approach to tackling this market? 

The total market size would be USD 2.50 trillion, which is the global K-12 education market size in 2023. Within this vast market, we want to set a new standard for formative assessments in STEM, starting with high schools in the US. With a narrow focus, we can fine tune our AI to be effective at learning STEM concepts. 

3. Who is your target customer? 

High schools focused on STEM subjects. We're primarily looking at private or charter schools right now for early customers so we have shorter sales cycles. 

4. How will you reach $1M in ARR (or equivalent milestone if your business’s first key metric isn’t revenue)? How will you acquire the customers/ users to get there? 

It would take us approximately 200 - 300 schools to reach $1M in ARR. Our current approach doesn't scale yet as we're using our personal networks and cold outreach. After the first 10 schools, we will have a clear idea on the specific distribution channels for our target user base.

Our product provides an 'aha' moment quite quickly and we feel that we can leverage this by sharing product links. We're hoping we can take a bottom up approach and reach schools through the teachers. All the teachers we've talked to so far have been fascinated and excited by what we're building.

6. Why do you think your company will succeed?
	
We have great founder-market fit due to our experience in education. For the past 7 years, Vignesh has been running a non profit which creates after-school learning spaces for marginalised children. He co-founded the non-profit and is actively engaged in teaching. As a PhD student at Georgia Tech, I have taught multiple courses at different universities and am also involved in administration of a private school in Bhubaneswar, India. 

Vignesh has also been a co-founder thrice before and has successfully scaled products to 100k+ users. Likhit has used neural networks extensively in my research and can build and deploy AI models. His expertise in machine learning and teaching experience make him the ideal CTO for developing Ira. Both of us are passionate about teaching and technology. 

There are three areas where we differ from the competition and where we feel our understanding is different and better
	1. Most people are building Ed Tech tools based on what GPT is good at. Being educators ourselves, we're able to build tools that teachers would benefit from. 
	2. Learning through creation not consumption. Most of the products today have students consuming content. When students teach an AI model we're allowing them to create something thus providing a different learning experience. 
	3. Known Unknowns vs Unknown Knowns. Products today largely focus on helping users learn something they don't know about. Instead, our product relies on metacognition and helps students discover what they know and how they know something. 
	4. Workflow. Though we have only interviewed a few teachers, they all feel like the AI EdTech products are out to replace them. Many are creating AI teachers or AI tutors and there is an inherent fear. Our product fits seamlessly in the teacher's workflow (even the questions and assignments they create need not change) and aims to enable them.

7. What’s your most impressive metric/story/data point that demonstrates your existing conviction / traction?

Our student demos were the most exciting part of our story so far. When we tested our product with students we found that all of them truly enjoyed working with Ira and found themselves challenged. Our sample was incredibly diverse with students from different economic backgrounds and children who were both doing well and poorly in school. Across this diverse group, we saw high levels of persistence and noticed that children were thinking critically about the concepts. As educators we are 100% sure that we have something exciting!
