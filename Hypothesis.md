Assumptions
- Constructivism - Knowledge happens through creation not consumption
- Known unknown problem is being solved a lot but the unknown known and unknown unknown problem remains quite a lot
- Understanding epistemology and using metacognition might help solve the unknown known problem

Challenges
- Learning is not necessarily linguistic

Pitch
- Rather than having learners answer a bunch of questions can we have them teach a GPT conceptually and have the GPT answer questions instead.
- In today's world it's a lot more valuable to assimilate and understand than simply solve problems. Computers and AI are easily going to solve problems and MCQs. Having a conceptual understanding becomes crucial.
- Could really change the game for assessments and exams completely and make something that is relevant in today's world.
- Bringing the power of debugging to children. Learning from mistakes rather than being penalised for it.

Other Points
- Doesn't threaten the system. Easy adoption. 
- Teacher time investment is a problem in general with Ed technology
- This being a trivial add on vs entire disruption with lot of effort and coordination is quite beneficial
- In ed tech often the older teachers are early adopters since they're more secure and confident
- One suggestions was to not position as assessment or homework but just to understand student understanding.
