5. What is your company going to make to solve this problem?
   
We are building Ira, an AI buddy that students can teach concepts to. Instead of answering questions, students have to explain to Ira how to solve them. Ira then "learns" from the explanation and attempts to solve a set of questions. Based on their explanations, we also build a knowledge graph representing the concepts that the students understood and those they didn't. The teachers can then use these knowledge graphs to adapt their future lesson plans or provide personalized interventions.
