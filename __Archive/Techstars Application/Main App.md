4. What problem are you looking to solve?

Based on our teaching experience, we found it difficult to accurately gauge the understanding of every student for STEM concepts. Traditional assignments promoted regurgitation of procedures and didn't identify gaps in understanding. We realized that asking a learner to explain a concept back to us was quite revealing. However, this was a lengthy process and not well-standardized. What if there was a product that enabled each student to teach and gave teachers the feedback from these sessions?
   
5. What is your company going to make to solve this problem?
   
We are building Ira, an AI buddy that students can teach concepts to. Instead of answering questions, students have to explain to Ira how to solve them. Ira then "learns" from the explanation and attempts to solve a set of questions. Based on their explanations, we also build a knowledge graph representing the concepts that the students understood and those they didn't. The teachers can then use these knowledge graphs to adapt their future lesson plans or provide personalized interventions.
