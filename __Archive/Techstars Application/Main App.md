3. What year was the company founded?
   2024
   
4. What problem are you looking to solve?

Based on our teaching experience, we found it difficult to accurately gauge the understanding of every student for STEM concepts. Traditional assignments promoted regurgitation of procedures and didn't identify gaps in understanding. We realized that asking a learner to explain a concept back to us was quite revealing. However, this was a lengthy process and not well-standardized. What if there was a product that enabled each student to teach and gave teachers the feedback from these sessions?
   
5. What is your company going to make to solve this problem?
   
We are building Ira, an AI buddy that students can teach concepts to. Instead of answering questions, students have to explain to Ira how to solve them. Ira then "learns" from the explanation and attempts to solve a set of questions. Based on their explanations, we also build a knowledge graph representing the concepts that the students understood and those they didn't. The teachers can then use these knowledge graphs to adapt their future lesson plans or provide personalized interventions.

11. Why is your team a winning team?

We have great founder-market fit due to our experience in education. For the past 7 years, Vignesh has been running a non profit which creates after-school learning spaces for marginalised children. He co-founded the non-profit and is actively engaged in teaching. As a PhD student at Georgia Tech, I have taught multiple courses at different universities and am also involved in administration of a private school in Bhubaneswar, India. Both of us are passionate about teaching and technology. Vignesh has previous founder experience that will be invaluable. With the Ira Project, he is working on a product where he has experienced the problem himself thus giving him the conviction to succeed. I have used neural networks extensively in my research and can build and deploy AI models. My expertise in machine learning combined with my love for teaching make me the ideal CTO for developing Ira. We have also known each other since our undergraduate days at Georgia Tech and work well in a team.

12. Please share any traction metrics you have.

We have built out an MVP and tested it out with 5 teachers and 5 students. We are about to launch a classroom-ready version.

13. How do you make money? How much could you make?

Currently, we haven't generated any revenue. We're thinking of starting out with a freemium model. We will provide a free tier for teachers to try our product in their classrooms so that we can acquire more data. For schools, we plan to charge them to administer and access assignments for their students.

14. Who is your target audience?

We are planning a B2B strategy where our target audience will be K-12 schools in the United States.

15. Who are your competitors?

Edtech companies that leverage AI to help K-12 students learn while giving teachers a tool to assess understanding. Some examples include FlintK12, Khan Academy, Kahoot.

16. What is your competetive advantage?

1) Most of the products today have students consuming content. By teaching an AI model, we're allowing them to create something - providing a different learning experience.
2) Our product helps students discover what they know and how they know something.
3) We are not creating AI tutors to replace physical teachers. Rather, our product fits into the teacher's workflow and aims to enable them.

17. Why is now the right timing for your startup?

The advent of LLMs has made it possible for AI models to undertstand and reason using natural language. This is the core requirement for creating an AI peer that can communicate and learn STEM concepts from students. 

18. What is your customer acquisition strategy?

Our first users for this product are going to be the teachers in Vignesh's non profit and Likhit's school. The next few users will be from our personal network that we have built with schools in Atlanta. We also plan to reach out to teacher forums on Reddit and Facebook.

19. What are your next major company milestones?

Converting a school to be our first customer.
