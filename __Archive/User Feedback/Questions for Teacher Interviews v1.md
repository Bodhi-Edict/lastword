Hi 'insert name here', we're currently working on a startup idea to help teachers better understand their students' learning. Before we demo the product to you and get your inputs we would love to ask you some questions so you can answer them without any bias towards our idea. 

1. What does understanding a topic mean to you? Could you give us an example topic and your objective for the learners?
2. How do you currently gauge whether the student has met this objective?
3. What is the hardest part about doing this process? 
4. When was the last time you had difficulty in identifying if students understood a particular concept?
5. Why was it difficult for you to assess and evaluate students?
6. What have you tried to do to understand your students better?
7. What donâ€™t you love about the solution you already tried?
