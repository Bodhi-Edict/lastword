- Build a rapport and get to understand the person you're interviewing
- Listen more don't talk much - "Tell me more" is a very powerful sentence to use as much as possible
- Talk about specifics and not about hypothetical situations
- Focus on the user's process and life more and less about your idea or product. Particularly don't try to ask specifically for what features might help.
