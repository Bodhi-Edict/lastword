- Overview about ViKa. 
	- What's initiative?
	- Where we are right now?
- Facilitator involvement and/or hiring facilitators. Lot of challenges they are facing personally. How can we support them but also hold them accountable?
- Engaging with youth once they leave the centre. Unable to connect with them and many of them have gone into a path of drinking, drugs etc. How can we support them better?
- We're looking to expand the team right now. Any references for a field coordinator in North Bangalore? 
- In fighting among groups in some communities. It's spread to children in one community and we're not able to keep the space inclusive.
