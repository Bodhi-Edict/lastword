### Purpose
I have an idea on how technology can be used for learning and I want to explore it a bit further and run some experiments. If I can find conviction in the idea and overcome my fear of failing I'll pursue it.

### Principles 
- Experiment - The idea is not to code out a perfect product or to constrain myself based on what I think I might be able to code out. The main goal is to get over my current mindset and get my building brain on.

### Outcome Visioning
Build out a quick and dirty pilot and start creating things again. Test it in one or two different settings with one or two different types of topics. Once you're feeling good about pursuing this you can work towards convincing others. 

### Brainstorming
- What do I already know about this project? I have a general idea of how I want to implement the idea but haven't worked out the details. I need to scope out an MVP and perhaps talk to someone with more of a teaching background. 
- What don’t I know that I need to find out? I need to brainstorm with a few others on how we can make the product look and what a MVP looks like. I particularly need to find the right topics and settings where this broader idea can be tested. 
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? Nivedh might be a good person to talk to. Similarly can speak to my mom who also has considerable teaching experience. Harithas and Sobhana also might be good resources to reach out to. 
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? I'm reading Seymour Papert already but I should also explore Jean Piaget and Resnick's ideas.
