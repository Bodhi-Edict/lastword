Agenda:
- Identifying specific market niche
- Go to market strategy
- Product design


1. Why is this approach better than using a GPT based test evaluator?

- Because traditional answering methods lend very well to regurgitation of procedural understanding
- Allows children to build a mental model and a knowledge graph

2. Is there a merit in having a single explanation for all topics?

- Communication skill gets built up
- Can force some level of thinking rather than just copy paste
- Yes because now we can build a knowledge graph for each child

3. Are there particular topics where we think this is significantly better as a method?

- At least as of we're limited to STEM
