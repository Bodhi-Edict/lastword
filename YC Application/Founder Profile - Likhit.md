3. Are you a technical founder?* (Required)

	Yes

4. Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
	 

5. Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

As part of my PhD, I set up data collection sites for obtaining 3D scans of pregnant women at four different health centres in Ethiopia. Then, I used this data to train a model that takes a raw 3D scan of a pregant woman as the input and predicts the 3D shape of that woman at future gestational periods. 

6. Tell us about things you’ve built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.

To help the nurses collect 3D scans of subjects at the maternal health centers, I built an iOS app that interfaced with the Structure 3D Sensor to acquire and processs 3D data on an iPad. This app is currently being used across four health centres in Ethiopia and has helped collect more than 2500 3D scans.

7. List any competitions/awards you have won, or papers you’ve published
