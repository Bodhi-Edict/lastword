1. How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

	We have known each other since 2015. We met during our undergraduate degree in Georgia Tech and were also roommates. 

2. Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

	The code and technical work for the product is done by both of the co-founders. Vignesh handles the web application while Likhit is responsible for the AI models.

4. Please record a one minute video introducing the founder(s) - TODO

5. Company name

	Ira Project

6. Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less

	We help students learn by teaching an AI study buddy

7. Company url

	https://github.com/Ira-Project

8. If you have a demo, attach it below - TODO


9. Please provide a link to the product, if relevant.

	bushwhack-one.vercel.app/

10. What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do? - TODO

	We are building an AI study buddy that students can teach concepts to. Rather than solving questions, students explain the concepts required to solve them. The AI then uses the student's explanations to attempt these questions. By iteratively teaching the AI to solve the questions correctly, the student is able to identify the gaps in their understanding.

12. Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?

	San Francisco, USA

13. Explain your decision regarding location.

	 The founders are currently based out of different locations. Vignesh lives in Bangalore, India while Likhit is completing his PhD at Georgia Tech. We are hoping to build this product in San Francisco so we can be close to the cutting edge in AI. 

14. How far along are you? - TODO

	We have built out a basic MVP and begun user testing. We have so far tested it with __ of our students. While using the product, the students had to exercise metacognition and it revealed quite clearly gaps in their understanding. We have also interviewed __ teachers and have got a buy in from __ of them to use it in their classrooms next year. 

16. How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

	Vignesh has been working on the product full time for the last four weeks. Likhit has been working part time while wrapping up the final stages of his PhD.

17. What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product?

	We've made a NextJS web application deployed on Vercel. Currently, the AI works through prompt engineering using GPT-4 assistants. We have started creating a dataset to train our own LLM. 

18. Are people using your product? When will you have a version people can use?

	No. We haven't publicly launched yet, we are still iterating over our intial MVP with user testing. We are planning to release a version for customers in a month. 

19. If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea? - TODO

	(Vignesh has applied to YC with a different idea while this is Likhit's first application.)
	
	I applied with a few different products but for the first time decided to solve a problem that I myself experience in my work with children and something that I had more conviction in.


20. If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it. - TODO

	Vignesh participated in Pioneer in his previous startup.

21. Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

	The Ira Project was born out of our own needs while working in education. Vignesh runs a non profit which creates after-school learning spaces for marginalised children. Likhit has taught multiple courses at different universities and is involved in administration of his school in Bhubaneswar, India. 
	 
	While working with students, both of us struggled with was gauging how well a student understood something. The traditional tests and assignments didn't identify the gaps in conceptual understanding. Often we would have to give personalised attention and we found that asking a learner to explain a concept back to us was revealing. 

22. Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

	FlintK12, Khan Academy, Kahoot
	There are three areas where we differ from the competition and where we feel our understanding is different
	1. Learning through creation not consumption. Most of the products today have students consuming content. When students teach an AI model we're allowing them to create something thus providing a different learning experience. 
	2. Known Unknowns vs Unknown Knowns. Products today largely focus on helping users learn something they don't know about. Instead, our product relies on metacognition and helps students discover what they know and how they know something. 
	3. Workflow. Though we have only interviewed a few teachers, they all feel like the AI EdTech products are out to replace them. Many are creating AI teachers or AI tutors and there is an inherent fear. Our product fits seamlessly in the teacher's workflow (even the questions and assignments they create need not change) and aims to enable them.

23. How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

	Currently we're thinking of a freemium model. Our current thought process is to provide a free tier for students to use so we can acquire more data. For schools, we plan to charge them to administer and access tests/assignments for their students. 

24. How do users find your product? How did you get the users you have now? If you run paid ads, what is your cost of acquisition?

	Our first users for this product are going to students in Vignesh's non profit and Likhit's school. The next few users will be from our personal network. We have worked with schools in Atlanta and have close friends who are teachers.

25. Where will most of your initial users be located?

	United States

26. If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder and founder title (e.g. CEO). (This question is as much for you as us.)

	Vignesh Prasad, Chief Executive Officer - 50%
	Likhit Nayak, Chief Technology Officer - 50%

27. If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application. - TODO

	

22. What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?

	Over the years we've met many YC founders, have watched lots of YC content, and attended a few events. We've heard about the value it can provide. When we saw the recent light cone podcast on how AI companies were built at YC it only reaffirmed our idea on how YC could give us the competitive advantage necessary to build a large company.

24.  How did you hear about Y Combinator?

	 We heard about YC from our friends back in college.
