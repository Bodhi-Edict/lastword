- Hi I'm Vignesh, Hi I'm Likhit and we're building the Ira project

- We've been working in education for a few years in various settings
- Best way to learn something is by teaching it
- Until now it's not been possible for everyone to be a teacher
- We want to use LLMs and we're building an application where students learn by teaching an AI study buddy

- Over the last month we've built out a working MVP and we've tested with a few students and interviewed teachers.
- Excited by the feedback so far
	- Students were able to identify boundaries of their understanding
	- Instead of being penalised for their mistakes they were able to learn iteratively
	- They had to think about communicating how to solve the problems
- Teachers want to use it in their classrooms 
- We think there's a huge opportunity to change the way examinations and assessments are done.
