	Throughout my career I've been building web applications. Outside of the startups listed in my experience I've built a few other applications as well :-
	- An election management application. I built a simple classification model and a Svelte Kit application for an acquaintance to help them with election strategy. The application classified users based on how likely they were to vote for the candidate and allowed the candidate to plan their campaign accordingly.
