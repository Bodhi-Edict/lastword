### What's the problem?

Formative assessments in STEM subjects often don't reveal conceptual understanding. Generating new assignments that require application of concepts is time consuming for teachers. 

Notes 
- I fear that this problem is not resonating hard enough
- Can we also include some "anecdata"? 
- Maybe the problem more strongly felt is that students are using GPT or Chegg for their assignments
- Another alternative is to maybe pitch getting children ready for a AI world. Concepts are going to be the focus there. 

### Who has the problem? What's the cost of not solving the problem?

STEM teachers face this problem more than others. In classrooms where there is a higher student to teacher ratio knowing each student's understanding level can be challenging. The cost of not solving the problem is that the students you're teaching will find themselves struggling later on when they don't have a good understanding of concepts. They may struggle in AP exams, SATs or in college thereby pulling down the school rankings. 

### How is this currently solved? Why doesn't that work?

Most teachers aren't trying to solve this simply because they don't have time. Some try classroom discussions and different types of assignments. This can be quite time consuming. Once a type of assignment or quiz is conducted it becomes ineffective in the future since the students now know how to solve it procedurally. Platforms like Chegg and even ChatGPT have made many assignments pretty meaningless. 

### What has changed?

AI has now made it possible for us to create tools to address this issue. We're able to apply Knowledge Space Theory at scale and generate Knowledge Graphs for every child using the Feynman technique. With the advent of LLMs we're able to create unique assignments for every child where they're creating and communicating their understanding rather than just replicating something. The flipped classroom is something that has been shown to work but now with LLMs we're able to do it at scale. 

### How do you know it's better?

From a science standpoint there's plenty of literature showing the efficacy of flipped classrooms and the Feynman technique. In our user testing we've also found that our platform pushes children to think about concepts and challenges them quite a lot. 

(Need to get some qualitative data on this to show)

### Pricing

We are charging $25 per student for the platform.
