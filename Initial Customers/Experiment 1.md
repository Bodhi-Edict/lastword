### What geography do we start with?

- US
	- More technology adoption
	- More schools as options
- UK
- India
	- More standardised curriculum
	- Very little technology adoption
	- Less competition

We feel it's probably better to start with US geography and a select few IB schools in India as well. For the US we will start with Atlanta and the Bay Area so there's a high chance that we can visit in person to close the deal. Given there's a higher degree of technology penetration we would be evaluated more correctly and get better feedback as well. 

### What type of school?

- Private schools
- Charter school
- Public school

Our instinct suggests that public schools might require a lot more approval and have a longer sales cycle but also Amrutha did say that public schools can work quite well and have sizable budgets for such things. We will reach out to all and split 50% between private/charter and public so we can get an idea on both and what might work better for us. 

### Personas we are reaching out to

- High School Math Teachers -> Second Option
- Technology leaders in schools -> First Option
- Principles in schools
- School administrators

There are two strategies here top down or bottom up. Ideally we would like to try both. Teachers are the ones who might truly feel the pain point and actually get excited by the product so we definitely want to reach out to them. They may also be able to point us on who is the right decision maker. 

Technology leaders are most likely the decision makers for EdTech in schools and understand what different technology does. They may be able to appreciate the difference we have built in to the product and may convert easier. 

### What are we sending exactly?

- The main hook we're going for is finding gaps in conceptual understanding 
- We've also explicitly avoided the usage of AI since we feel that there might be fatigue around this buzzword
- We should also try to tailor the message to some degree. 
- See [[LinkedIn Initial Message Outreach Template]]

### CTA in the message

There is no explicit CTA we would seek a manual onboarding here and follow up with a calendly link to the user. For the first few customers we want to be very high touch and also filter for users who might be design partners.

### LinkedIn Qualifier

- Look for people with some history so we know they might check LinkedIn
- Make sure their description makes sense for what we're messaging them about

### Learnings

- Teachers in general are much harder to reach on LinkedIn. The majority of them that are on LinkedIn are looking to make a career transition into a different type of role. 
- Charter school administrators and teachers aren't too active on LinkedIn
- The response rates are not too bad at around 10% or so which is a lot higher than I've experienced with OpenOS or LinkedIn
- So far all the responses have been rejections. Small sample size but it might be because we haven't connected with them on the pain points.
