### Purpose

So far we've conducted user interviews with those people that we know. While the response has been positive there really is no better validation than getting paying customers. Our goal is to get two to three paying customers to try out and use our product. The idea is to not to optimise revenue but to get invested customers so we can get honest feedback. 

### Principles 
- Feature requests. While feature requests are feedback in some form it's important to not get into building too much and actually getting users to use the product. 
- Learning. This process is going to be critical to us to inform our acquisition strategy as well going forward. We should try to iterate and learn as much as possible. 

### Brainstorming
- What do I already know about this project? - We've done some customer acquisition through LinkedIn and OpenOS but nothing really in the ed tech space. We can try the traditional channels and explore our personal network initially to see if those approaches work.
- What donâ€™t I know that I need to find out? - I don't really know what works well to get in touch with schools and teachers.
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? - Aditya and Amrutha have gone through the journey of getting schools as customers. It's worth talking to them about their process.
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? - YC has some great videos about getting early customers.
