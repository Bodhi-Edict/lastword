	- Probability is defined as the product between number of favourable outcomes and total outcomes. Favourable outcomes are the events we want to happen and total outcomes are all the possible things that can happen. For multiple events the probability is computed as the product of each event. Keep in mind that in some cases items may be removed and the total outcomes can change.
