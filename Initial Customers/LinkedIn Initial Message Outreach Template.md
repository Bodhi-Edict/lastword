Hi {Teacher's Name},

My name is Vignesh and I'm building a platform that helps STEM teachers assess and identify gaps in every student's conceptual understanding. We're currently rolling out pilots and thought your school would be a good fit since {if reason exists}. 

I would love to find some time to show you a demo of what we're building. Would sometime on Friday work? If it's easier feel free to choose a time here - calendly.com/ira-project/demo

Best,
Vignesh

- The messaging is clearly not resonating with prospects and we did not get any hits in the first round of messages. In this message we want to make the problem statement more clear. 
- Rather than pitching ourselves as demoing a pilot decided to share a demo video directly in the email and treat it as a sales message. 
- Including a video with tracking would also help us understand if prospects are clicking and watching our videos. 
- Updated the subject to directly communicate the problem statement rather than something vague. 
- Took some ideas from Founding Sales book.

Hi {Teacher's Name},

I hope you're having a great day! I'm Vignesh and I'm the founder of Ira Project, a platform that helps STEM teachers assess and identify gaps in every student's conceptual understanding. 

As an educator myself I know how hard it is to keep a track of every child's learning and we've built Ira Project to solve just that. {Insert any reason from their profile that makes them specifically more relevant}. Here's a demo for you to check out - 

I would love to show you how Ira Project could work at your school. Do you have 20 minutes next week? If it's easier feel free to choose a time here - calendly.com/ira-project/demo

Best,
Vignesh
