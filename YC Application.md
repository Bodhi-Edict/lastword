1. How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

	We have known each other since 2015. We met during our undergraduate degree in Georgia Tech and were roommates. 

2. Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

	The code and technical work for the product is done by both of the co-founders. Vignesh handles the entire web application consumer facing side of things while Likhit is more responsible for the AI models. Vignesh has experience building web applications having already performed a similar role in previous startups. Likhit has expertise in training AI models in his PhD degree where he trained models for medical devices.

8. Please provide a link to the product, if relevant.

	

9. What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do?

	We are building an AI study buddy that users can teach concepts to. Our product works similar to a coding test platform. Instead of writing code, users write an explanation for a particular topic. The AI uses the explanation to answer a few questions (test cases). Based on the results the user is able to identify gaps in their understanding and learn better. We want to bring the power of debugging to problems outside of coding. 


10. Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?

	Bangalore, India / San Francisco, USA

11. Explain your decision regarding location.

	 The founders currently stay in different locations. Vignesh lives in Bangalore, India while Likhit is completing his PhD in Atlanta, USA. We are hoping to build this product in San Francisco so we can be close to the cutting edge in AI. 

12. How far along are you?

	Not far. 
	We have built out a basic MVP to serve our own needs and have begun user testing. We have so far tested it with __ of our students and have found that the product reveals quite clearly gaps in children's understanding. We have also interviewed __ teachers and have got a buy in from __ of them to use it in their classrooms next year. 

13. How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

	Vignesh has been working on the product full time for the last two weeks. Likhit has been working part time while wrapping up the final stages of his PhD. Both of us spent two weeks before starting the building process to study literature on teaching to learn and building a better understanding on the capabilities of LLMs.

14. What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product?

	Currently we've made a NextJS web application deployed on Vercel. The AI is currently running through creative prompts to GPT-4 assistants. In the future we plan to fine tune an open source model or train our own LLM. 

15. If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

	(Vignesh has applied to YC with a different idea while this is Likhit's first application.)
	I applied with a few different products but for the first time decided to solve a problem that I myself experience in my work with children and something that I had more conviction in. 
	
	Previously I was building an no code data science tool with a different co-founder. One of the biggest mistakes we made in the previous product was that we had very 'low quality reps'. Without enough conviction in the idea we had, we pivoted without learning much when leads from LinkedIn didn't materialise.
	
	The other learning was learning about the ineffectiveness of working in silos. One of us was doing sales and talking to users and one of us did the coding which meant that neither of us saw the whole picture clearly. 

16. If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

	Vignesh participated in Pioneer in his previous startup. Pioneer was a good experience and working in a cohort and learning from other startups was beneficial. More than anything being in the Bay Area was inspiring and we felt a lot more driven to move fast. 

17. Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

	 The Ira Project was born out of our own needs while working in education. Vignesh runs a non profit which creates after school learning spaces for marginalised children. Likhit has taught multiple courses at Georgia Tech and is involved in the running and administration of his school in Bhubaneswar, India. 
	 
	 In our work one thing that both of us struggled with was gauging how well a student understood something. The traditional tests and assignments simply did not reveal the gaps in conceptual understanding. Often we would have to give personalised attention and we found that asking a learner to explain a concept back to us was quite revealing. 

18. Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

	FlintK12, Khan Academy, Brilliant. 
	There are three areas where we differ from the competition and where we feel our understanding is different
	1. Learning through creation not consumption. Most of the products today have users consuming content to learn. By allowing users to teach an AI model we're allowing them to create something and a different learning experience. 
	2. Known Unknowns vs Unknown Knowns. Products today largely focus on helping users learn an unknown they don't know about. Our product relies on metacognition and helps users discover what they know and how they know something. 
	3. Workflow. Though we have only interviewed a few teachers many of the teachers we spoke to feel like the AI EdTech products are out to replace them. Many are creating AI teachers or AI teaching assistants and there is an inherent fear. Our product fits seamlessly in the teacher's workflow (even the questions and assignments they create need not change) and aims to enable them and provides them another tool to work with. 

19. How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

	 Currently we're thinking of a freemium model. Our current thought process is to provide a free tier for students to use so we can acquire more data. For school we plan to charge them to administer and access tests/assignments for their students. 

20. How do users find your product? How did you get the users you have now? If you run paid ads, what is your cost of acquisition?

	Our first users for this product are going to be ourselves - students in Vignesh's non profit and Likhit's school. The next few users will be from our personal network, we have worked with Atlanta school and have close friends who are teachers. 
	
	To be perfectly honest, we don't have a coherent acquisition strategy yet. In Vignesh's previous companies he found some success with personal outreach and then organic growth so we would rely on similar strategies though it must be said that they were in a very different domain.

21. If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.

	asdfasdf

22. What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?

	Over the years we've met many YC founders, have watched lots of YC content, and attended a few events. We've heard about the value it can provide. When we saw the recent light cone podcast on how AI companies were built at YC it only reaffirmed our idea on how YC could give us the competitive advantage necessary to build a large company.

24.  How did you hear about Y Combinator?

	 We heard about YC from our friends back in college.
