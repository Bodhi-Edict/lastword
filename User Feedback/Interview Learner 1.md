Post Demo
- UI was very unclear. He didn't read through the instructions at the start. Once he started the test he tried to highlight the blank in the question.
- He reverted immediately to pen and paper to try and solve the question. Perhaps he felt intimidated that he didn't immediately know the answer. 
- The compute button below was hidden by scroll so that's something we need to make sure to fix.
- While loading you can't move on to the next question which is a problem.
- The compute question didn't work at all the first time around not sure why it failed completely. 
- Everyone is so used to putting the answer. The user even tried to click on the blank in one of the questions to try and enter things there. 
- The traditional ideas of how to do things are very deep rooted. Even after reading the explanation the learner thought that they must enter the answer as well as an explanation. The UI needs to somehow make it clear to the learner how things work.
