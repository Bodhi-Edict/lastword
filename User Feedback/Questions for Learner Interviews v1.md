Hi 'insert name here', we're currently working on a startup idea to make learning more enjoyable. Before we demo the product to you and get your inputs we would love to ask you some questions so you can answer them without any bias towards our idea. 

1. What is your typical process when learning a new topic? Could you share an example? 
2. What does understanding a topic mean to you? Could you give us an example topic and your objective for the learners?
3. How do you know when you have learnt a topic completely or if you need to revise further?
4. What have you tried anything in terms of learning and understanding a new topic?

Thanks for your time
