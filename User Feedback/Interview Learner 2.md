Demo
- UI wasn't clear at all. It was extremely unclear where to type at all. The user was confused and given they weren't very comfortable with technology in general felt like they were the ones making some sort of mistake.
- User decided to write the answer first. The app gave feedback that her answer was wrong and then later that it was correct which left her quite confused. 
- The user then realised that they had to provide an explanation and attempted that. They initially tried an explanation that worked for a single question and was very confused what to do when navigating to a different question. 
- When I intervened and pointed out that the same explanation has to work for all questions they understood that they needed to abstract information.
- In the Ashley question the feedback from the application did not indicate why they were getting it wrong. The user was able to work out though that she had given the wrong formula for combining events and managed to fix it. It must be noted that the tester did intervene here and asked some questions. 
	- Something to avoid in the future so we get honest impressions. Resist the urge to help.
- Later on in the Ashley question when the user did not include that sometimes the ball is removed they could not figure out what was wrong with their explanation. They thought that something they had written was incorrect and second guessed their ideas. Due to paucity of time, the tester showed what was needed.

Bugs
