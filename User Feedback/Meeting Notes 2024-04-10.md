Talking Points:
1. How are we framing the problem
	- Identifying gaps in conceptual understanding
		- The main challenge now is learners have a procedural idea but not a conceptual idea
2. User interview script
	- Teachers and students are slightly different use cases
		- Teachers we want to understand how they're solving the problem of gauging understanding
		- For students we want to also understand how they interact and use the product and if our approach actually reveals conceptual gaps
3. List of users to interview
4. Timeline for user testing
	- User interviews starting on 15th April
		- Entire probability test needs to work 
	- Teacher interviews starting on 12th April
		- Need only one or two working assistants
	- Likhit will update assistant IDs in the database
5. YC Application timeline
	- First draft by 15th April
	- We should aim to finish the application on 17th April
	- Get feedback and submit by 20th
6. LLMs and how we want to approach the AI in general
	- In general the approach seems to be starting with an open source LLM and fine tune it for our specific purpose
