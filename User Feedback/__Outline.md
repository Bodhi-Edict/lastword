### Purpose

We've almost completed an MVP of what we wanted to build. We don't have a lot of subjects and topics and the model isn't perfect but we're getting reasonable results with around three topics across three subjects. The goal is to use the MVP and get some user feedback. There are two types of users that will use this product and we'd like to get insights from both. 
1. Teachers - Teachers will use this tool as assignments or tests to get a gauge of learner understanding and where they may be gaps in the learner's knowledge. 
2. Learners - Learners use this tool either in a self directed manner or as a task assigned by their teacher. The main problem we are trying to solve for the self directed learner like the teacher is to help them get a gauge of their own understanding. 

### Principles 
- Listen Don't Talk - It's important to ask a few questions to them before actually showing what we've built or talking about our rationale.
- Detached - It's very important to not be too attached to what we've built so far and our own ideas and plans. The goal is to learn as much as possible from users. 
- Speed - It's sometimes easy to get caught up in product feedback and not iterate on what we've built. We should try to get this out of the way in our designated two week deadline. 

### Outcome Visioning
Demo a reasonably functioning MVP to learners. Understand how they're using the product and get a clear idea of what UI changes are needed. Speak to teachers and school administrators to help scope out future features. Those who we speak to become early adopters of the product and can deploy it in their schools as soon as it's ready. 

### Brainstorming
- What do I already know about this project? We have an idea what we're looking to understand. We also know a few teachers and learners to test this out with. 
- What donâ€™t I know that I need to find out? It's good to build a stronger understanding on how to conduct user interviews. 
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? Aditya Vishwanath might be a good person to talk to regarding how to approach learners and teachers. 
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? YC has a lot of good resources on this. It's worth revisiting those videos.
