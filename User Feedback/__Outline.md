### Purpose
We've almost completed an MVP of what we wanted to build. We don't have a lot of subjects and topics and the model isn't perfect but we're getting reasonable results with around three topics across three subjects. The goal is to use the MVP and get some user feedback. There are a few things we'd like to understand from learners
- Do learners understand how to use the product
- Are learners enjoying this process of teaching an AI
- Does the product help identify any gaps in understanding for learners
- How well does the model perform to real users
We also want to get a teacher's perspective on the tool. We'd like to understand what challenges they are facing and how they might use a tool like this. These are a few of the things we'd like to understand from teachers
- Do teachers feel that it might help students from their perspective
- Where in their workflow if at all do teachers see such a tool fit in
- What if anything might make the tool more appealing for them to use
From teacher's we might not end up getting unbiased feedback since we won't be watching them use the tool but will more demo the tool and interview them. It's important to ask a few questions to them before actually showing them what we've built. 

### Principles 
- Detached - It's very important to not be too attached to what we've built so far and our own ideas and plans. The goal is to learn as much as possible from users. 
- Speed - It's sometimes easy to get caught up in product feedback and not iterate on what we've built. We should try to get this out of the way in our designated two week deadline. 

### Outcome Visioning
Demo a reasonably functioning MVP to learners. Understand how they're using the product and get a clear idea of what UI changes are needed. Speak to teachers and school administrators to help scope out future features. Those who we speak to become early adopters of the product and can deploy it in their schools as soon as it's ready. 

### Brainstorming
- What do I already know about this project? We have an idea what we're looking to understand. We also know a few teachers and learners to test this out with. 
- What donâ€™t I know that I need to find out? It's good to build a stronger understanding on how to conduct user interviews. 
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? Aditya Vishwanath might be a good person to talk to regarding how to approach learners and teachers. 
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? YC has a lot of good resources on this. It's worth revisiting those videos.
